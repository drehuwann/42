Exercise 00 : display_file
Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in : Makefile, and files needed for your program
Allowed functions : close, open, read, write

Create a program called ft_display_file that displays, on the standard output,
only the content of the file given as argument.
The submission directory should have a Makefile with the following rules : all,
clean, fclean. The binary will be called ft_display_file.
The malloc function is forbidden. You can only do this exercise by declaring a
fixed-sized array.
All files given as arguments will be valid.
Error messages have to be displayed on their reserved output followed by a new
line.
If no argument is given, it should display
File name missing.

If there is more than one argument, it should display
Too many arguments.

If the file cannot be read, it should display
Cannot read file.

Chapter IV
Exercise 01 : cat
Turn-in directory : ex01/
Files to turn in : Makefile, and files needed for your program
Allowed functions : close, open, read, write, strerror, basename

Create a program called ft_cat which does the same thing as the system’s cat
command-line.
You don’t have to handle options.
The submission directory should have a Makefile with the following rules : all,
clean, fclean.
You may use the variable errno (check the man for Errno).
You should read the man of all the authorized functions
You can only do this exercise by declaring a fixed-sized array. This array will
have a size limited to a little less than 30 ko. In order to test that
size-limit, use the ulimit command-line in your Shell.

Chapter V
Exercise 02 : tail
Turn-in directory : ex02/
Files to turn in : Makefile, and files needed for your program
Allowed functions : close, open, read, write, malloc, free, strerror,
basename

Create a program called ft_tail which does the same thing as the system command
tail.
The only option you have to handle is -c, but you don’t need to handle ’+’ or
’-’ signs.
all the test will be done with the -c option.
The submission directory should have a Makefile with the following rules : all,
clean, fclean.
You may use the variable errno.

Chapter VI
Exercise 03 : hexdump
Turn-in directory : ex03/
Files to turn in : Makefile, and files needed for your program
Allowed functions : close, open, read, write, malloc, free, strerror,
basename

Create a program called ft_hexdump which does the same thing as the system’s
hexdump command-line without redirection.
The only option you have to handle is -C.
The submission directory should have a Makefile with the following rules : all,
clean, fclean.
You may use the variable errno.
