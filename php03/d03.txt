Chapter 1
Foreword
Here is some of what Wikipedia has to say about Apaches:

The Apache are culturally related Native American tribes from the
Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico.

These indigenous

peoples of North America speak Southern Athabaskan languages, which are
related linguistically to Athabaskan languages in Alaska and western
Canada.

Apache people traditionally have lived in Eastern Arizona, Northern
Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua), New Mexico, West Texas, and Southern
Colorado.

Apacheria, their collective homelands, consists of high

mountains, sheltered and watered valleys, deep canyons, deserts, and
the southern Great Plains.

The Apache tribes fought the invading

Spanish and Mexican peoples for centuries. The first Apache raids on
Sonora appear to have taken place during the late 17th century.

In

19th-century confrontations during the American-Indian wars, the U.S.
Army found the Apache to be fierce warriors and skillful strategists.

Apache groups are politically autonomous.

The major groups speak

several different languages and developed distinct and competitive
cultures. The current post-colonial division of Apache groups includes
Western Apache, Chiricahua, Mescalero, Jicarilla, Lipan, and Plains
Apache (also known as the Kiowa-Apache). Apache groups live in Oklahoma
and Texas and on reservations in Arizona and New Mexico. Apache people
have moved throughout the United States and elsewhere, including urban
centers.

General Instructions
• Only this page will serve as reference; do not trust rumors.
• Watch out! This document could potentially change up to an hour
before submission.

• Only the work submitted on the repository will be accounted for
during peer-2-peer correction.

• As when you did C Piscine, your exercises will be corrected by
your peers AND/OR by Moulinette.

• Moulinette is very meticulous and strict in its evaluation of
your work. It is entirely automated and there is no way to
negotiate with it. So if you want to avoid bad surprises, be as
thorough as possible.

• Using a forbidden function is considered cheating. Cheaters get
-42, and this grade is non-negotiable.

• These exercises are carefully laid out by order of difficulty from easiest to hardest. We will not take into account a
successfully completed harder exercise if an easier one is not
perfectly functional.

• You cannot leave any additional file in your repository than
those specified in the subject.

• Got a question? Ask your peer on the right. Otherwise, try your
peer on the left.

• Your reference guide is called Google / the Internet /
http://www.php.net / ....

• Think of discussing on the Forum. The solution to your problem
is probably there already. Otherwise you will start the
conversation.

• Examine the examples thoroughly. They could very well call for
details that are not explicitly mentioned in the subject …

• By Odin, by Thor ! Use your brain !!!

Exercise

00 : Install

Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in:
Allowed functions:

For the first exercise, your only task will be to install bitnami
MAMP. Watch carefully the video for the installation.

We strongly

encourage you to explore the configuration possibilities for MAMP and,
most importantly, to read the documentation as you will need it for
all the exercises of today.

For the examples in the following exercises, we will consider that you
have a directory d03 in the htdocs and that you are using Apache (in
the apache2/ directory).

You can find the manager for bitnami MAMP here
/path/to/mamp/manager-osx.app which you can use to open the

software.

of phpinfo().

$> curl 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex01/phpinfo.php'
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ``-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN'' ``DTD/xhtml1transitional.dtd''>

Files to turn in: print_get.php
Allowed functions:

Create a file named print_get.php that will display all the variables
passed in the url.

Example:

$> curl 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex02/print_get.php?login=mmontinet'
login: mmontinet
$> curl 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex02/print_get.php?gdb=pied2biche&barry=
barreamine'
gdb: pied2biche
barry: barreamine
$>

Exercise

03 : cookie_crisp

Turn-in directory : ex03/
Files to turn in: cookie_crisp.php
Allowed functions: setcookie() and time()

Create a file cookie_crisp.php that will allow you to create, read and
erase a cookie.

Example:

$> curl -c cook.txt 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex03/cookie_crisp.php?action=set
&name=food&value=choucroute'
$> curl -b cook.txt 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex03/cookie_crisp.php?action=get
&name=food'
choucroute
$> curl -c cook.txt 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex03/cookie_crisp.php?action=del
&name=food'
$> curl -b cook.txt 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex03/cookie_crisp.php?action=get

Exercise

04 : raw_text

Turn-in directory : ex04/
Files to turn in: raw_text.php
Allowed functions: header()

Create a file named raw_text.php that will display the exact same thing
whether you look at your browser or if you look at its source code
with curl.

$> curl 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex04/raw_text.php'
<html><body>Hello</body></html>
$>

If you have lynx, you can test it like that (right down to the newline).

$> lynx -dump 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex04/raw_text.php'
<html><body>Hello</body></html>
$> lynx -source 'http://localhost:8080/d03/ex04/raw_text.php'
<html><body>Hello</body></html>
$>

Chapter 8
Exercise

05 : read_img

Turn-in directory : ex05/
Files to turn in: read_img.php
Allowed functions: header(), readfile()

Create a file named read_img.php that will return to the browser the
file 42.png with the right Content-Type. You will find this file in
the attachment section on the intranet.
You must submit it in your repository inside a folder named img so
that we can use it again in other exercises.

$> ls ../img/
42.png
$> curl --head http://localhost:8080/d03/ex05/read_img.php
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 26 Mar 2013 09:42:42 GMT
Server: Apache
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.4.26
Content-Type: image/png
$>

Exercise

06 : members_only

Turn-in directory : ex06/
Files to turn in: members_only.php
Allowed functions: header(), echo. $_SERVER, file_get_contents,
base64_encode

Create a file members_only.php that will require a login/password at
the HTTP protocol level.

If the login is "zaz" and the password is

"Ilovemylittleponey", the response must be an HTML page that contains

an img tag which source is directly the image "/img/42.png". You must
not provide the image URL (we will probably change the content of the
image during the evaluation).

You need to reproduce the following example:

$> curl --user zaz:Ilovemylittleponey http://localhost:8080/d03/ex06/
members_only.php
<html><body>
Hello Zaz<br />
<img src='data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAA...
...
...
...6MIHnr2t+eeO4Fr+v/H80AmcVvzqAfAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'>
</body></html>
$>

If the login/password doesn’t match "zaz"/"Ilovemylittleponey", return
an error message exactly like in the following example:

$> curl -v --user root:root http://localhost:8080/d03/ex06/members_only.php
