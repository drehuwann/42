Chapter IV
Exercise 01 : testShell00
Exercise 01
What are attributes anyway ?
Turn-in directory : ex01/
Files to turn in : testShell00.tar
Allowed functions : None

Create a file called testShell00 in your submission directory.
Figure out a way for the output to look like this
(except for the “total 1” line):
%> ls -l
total 1
-r--r-xr-x 1 XX XX 40 Jun 1 23:42 testShell00
%>

Once you’ve achieved the previous steps, execute the following command to
create the file to be submitted: tar -cf testShell00.tar testShell00.

Don’t worry about what you’ve got instead of "XX".

A year will be accepted instead of the time, on the timestamp of the file.

-rwx--xr--	1	XX 4 Jun 1 21:46 test1
dr-x---r--	2	XX XX Jun 1 22:45 test2
-r-----r--	2	XX 1 Jun 1 23:44 test3
-rw-r----x	1	XX 2 Jun 1 23:43 test4
-r-----r--	2	XX 1 Jun 1 23:44 test5
lrwxr-xr-x	1	XX 5 Jun 1 22:20 test6 -> test0


Once you’ve done that, run tar -cf exo2.tar * to create the file to be
submitted.

Don’t worry about what you’ve got instead of "XX".

A year will be accepted instead of the time, on the timestamp of the
