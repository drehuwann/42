automated and there is no way to negotiate with it. So if you want to avoid bad
surprises, be as thorough as possible.

Chapter II
Foreword
Here are the lyrics for City Hunter’s theme song "Moonlight Shadow":
The last time ever she saw him
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn’t find how to push through
The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn’t find how to push through
[Chorus]
I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven far away...
I stay, I pray
See you in Heaven one day.
Four A.M. in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
A star was glowing in the silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn’t find how to push through
[Chorus]

Shell 00

Far away on the other side.
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
The night was heavy and the air was alive
But she couldn’t find how to push through
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Far away on the other side.
Unfortunately, this topic has nothing to do with City Hunter.
