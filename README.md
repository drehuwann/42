### Work in progress !
This is an attempt to complete, in my spare time, the <i>Epitech</i>
(alias <i>42</i>) school cursus, commonly named <i>'piscine'</i>.<br>
<br>
### Architecture of repository / Usage
Each subdirectory of this repo contains, besides the exercises such as they
should be returned, another subdir named <code>build</code>.<br>
This subdir generally contains :<br>
1. <b><code>&#42;.txt</code></b> : This is the subject of the exercises,
extracted from heavy <code>*.pdf</code> files, and cleaned, to keep only
useful information.<br>
2. <b><code>Makefile</code> :</b> To build the tests. Simply <code>chdir</code>
 or <code>pushd</code> to build directory and type <code>make</code><br>
 Alternatively, if test has failed : <code>make debug</code><br>
 Generally, it produces a <code>tst</cAde> file, that you can run with
 <code>./tst</code><br>
3. <b><code>source files</code> :</b> required to build the tests.<br><br>
### Note about coding style
The style is <b>not</b> <i>norminette</i> compliant. But it is generally
formatted to fit in a 80*25 CGA environment ...<br>
Nevertheless, if somebody has info about the specs of the <i>norminette</i>,
please let me know, so maybe one day we'll code, in our spare time, a
lightweight automatic <b><code>norminator</code></b> !#<br>
