Foreword
"I realized the moment I fell into the fissure, that the book would
not be destroyed as I had planned.

It continued falling into that

starry expanse, of which I had only a fleeting glimpse. I have tried
to speculate where it might have landed, and I must admit however,
such conjecture is futile.

Still, questions about whose hands might

one day hold my Books are unsettling to me. I know my apprehensions
might never be allayed... and so I close, realizing that perhaps the
ending has not yet been written."

General Instructions
• Only this page will serve as reference; do not trust rumors.
• Watch out! This document could potentially change up to an hour
before submission.

• Only the work submitted on the repository will be accounted for
during peer-2-peer correction.

• As when you did C Piscine, your exercises will be corrected by
your peers AND/OR by Moulinette.

• Moulinette is very meticulous and strict in its evaluation of
your work. It is entirely automated and there is no way to
negotiate with it. So if you want to avoid bad surprises, be as
thorough as possible.

• Using a forbidden function is considered cheating. Cheaters get
-42, and this grade is non-negotiable.

• These exercises are carefully laid out by order of difficulty from easiest to hardest. We will not take into account a
successfully completed harder exercise if an easier one is not
perfectly functional.

• You cannot leave any additional file in your repository than
those specified in the subject.

• Got a question? Ask your peer on the right. Otherwise, try your
peer on the left.

• Your reference guide is called Google / the Internet /
http://www.php.net / ....

• Think of discussing on the Forum. The solution to your problem
is probably there already. Otherwise you will start the
conversation.

• Examine the examples thoroughly. They could very well call for
details that are not explicitly mentioned in the subject …

• By Odin, by Thor ! Use your brain !!!

00 : Another World

Turn-in directory : ex00/
Files to turn in: another_world.php
Allowed functions: The whole standard PHP library especially regexp

I do not know where I landed. I just woke up, I’m lying in the grass
and I see the sky above the treetops.

I’m lost.

The Book is near

me. It could have been worse; I could find myself leaning on my desk
appearing suddenly in the middle of a gigantic pool inhabited by a
kraken. Fortunately this is not the case. I began to explore around.
This world is different. The relation with the surrounding space is
very strange.

Sometimes we make a single step, but in reality it's

like we're making eight. I started to lose the habit of slowing down.
Everywhere there were varied combinations of normal space and strange
spaces, I decided to set a single normal space.

The book seems to

dedicate a whole chapter, using the terms ' ' and '\t', to respectively
designate natural spaces and strange spaces.

$> ./another_world.php "This

Note:

I have found a kind of rocky headland.

I’m on an island!

I

don't know how I got there or how I’ll get out of it. But tomorrow is
another day.

Besides, what day are

Time does not have the same meaning here obviously.

I

notice, flipping the book that some inscriptions could correspond to
dates. I will try to decipher them. Midday: this is it! I found it.
These inscriptions are systematically of the following form:
Day_of_the_week Number_of_day Month Year Hours:Minutes:Seconds
The day of the week is complete, full, sometimes with an uppercase
at the beginning, and in French.
2 characters.

The day’s number is always 1 or

The month is expressed in words, sometimes also with

a capital letter at the beginning, and always in French.

Finally, hours, minutes and seconds are all

There are 4 spaces to separate 5 pieces.

I will now

be able to identify more easily if some passages correspond to dates,
and convert them to a more rational mode and more readable form: the
number of seconds past since January 1, 1970.

OOC: Yes, there is a reason why the days of the week and
months are not in English. Look online if you need a bit of
help with the translation.

Exercice

02 : The magnifying glass

Turn-in directory : ex02/
Files to turn in: magnifying_glass.php
Allowed functions: The whole standard PHP library

This morning, examining the binding of the Book, I noticed a small
recess. Inside I gently pulled out a small magnifying glass. It was
really very special.

At first I thought it did not make anything

bigger. But by trying it on several pages, I noticed that it only made
bigger the links to other pages of the Book, by simply putting everything in uppercase! I had to process each page one by one to see it.

$> cat > page.html
<html><head><title>Nice page</title></head>
<body>Hello World <a href=http://cyan.com title="a link">This is a link</a>
<br /><a href=http://www.riven.com> And this too <img src=wrong.image title="

03 : Who are you ?

Turn-in directory : ex03/
Files to turn in: who.php
Allowed functions: No use of system call 'who'

I am not alone!

There are people on this island!

I got proof this

morning following a footprint in the forest area. I found myself nose
to nose with a strange individual, who seemed also amazed by this
meeting like me. I asked him who he was, but I only got snippets of
words like “utmp” and other elusive grunts. Afraid, he left quickly.
Perhaps it will take time but soon, I will know where we are and why
I’m here. I noted in the Book, each of my meetings.

Note: I think it’s me. I mean, I think the person I met was me. But

I am beginning to lose all hope to leave this place.

04 : Photo booklet

Turn-in directory : ex04/
Files to turn in: photos.php
Allowed functions: The whole standard PHP library and curl

I tried to make some drawings on the blank pages at the end of the
Book but it was useless.

Only the words could remain, my sketches

disappeared in less time than it took me to draw them. That’s when I
started to dedicate a page to a precise description of a particular
location on the island, that, the unpredictable happens. I had hardly
written the name of the place as title, when a whole set of pictures
of this place started to fill the page. This book takes pictures! I
was able to list all the points of interest of my new home. This Book
is undoubtedly very surprising!

$> ls
photos.php
$> ./photos.php "http://www.42.fr"
$> ls
photos.php

$> ls www.42.fr/

Note: I realize nevertheless that the pictures are not taken at random.
It’s only when there is, in a place, a form of tag characterized by 3
letters I, M and G, that the picture is taken.

This island can only exist in my imagination.

Such a

strange and tortured place can’t be real.

I don’t want to open the

book anymore, I don’t want to do anymore puzzles.

The latest:

ev-

erything I wrote to remember of my real life was found mixed between
the same three pages. I had to continually re-order my ideas, only to
remember the name and surname of my friends. At the price of a long and
laborious effort, I was able by means of a unique identifier, deceive
the Book and regroup the scattered information.

By writing "display

the name of login XXX", the Book finds me the information sought.

Note: Are they really my friends? I can no longer put a face to these

06 : The Parchment

Turn-in directory : ex06/
Files to turn in: srt.php
Allowed functions: The whole standard PHP library

I found a sort of parchment yesterday on what I call the northern coast
of the island ; near a large crevasse from which I cannot even see the
bottom. This should rejoice me to know that there are or there have
been others like me here. I’m too depressed and I really paid attention
only this morning.

The parchment consists of incomprehensible text

snippets interspersed with precise time stamps (I know how to recognize it now). There are however inconsistencies. Some hours are not
in order. I am not sure if I really want to solve this new puzzle, yet…
